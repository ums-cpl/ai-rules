## Adding or Changing Rules

1. Edit or add files under `rules/`. Use `.md` with YAML frontmatter.
2. Test the rules in your editor (e.g. Cursor).
3. Open a pull request for review before merging.

## Rule Guidelines

- Keep rules concise and focused.
- Use `description` in frontmatter so the AI (and users) understand the rule's purpose.
- Prefer `globs` for file-specific rules instead of `alwaysApply: true` where possible.
- Avoid personal preferences; focus on team or project conventions.

## Questions
