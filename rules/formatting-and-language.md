# Formatting and Language

## Typography

Use Title Case for all user-visible headings and titles.
Do not alter casing inside code, filenames, identifiers, or verbatim text.
Only use a different style if the user explicitly requests it.

## Language

When using English, use American English unless explicitly requested otherwise.

All source code---including comments, identifiers, strings (e.g., error messages), and documentation---is to be written in English unless explicitly requested otherwise.
