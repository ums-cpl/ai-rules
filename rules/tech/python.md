# Python Style (Apply **Only** to Python Content)

## Applicability Gate (MUST be checked before applying)

These rules apply **exclusively** to Python documents.

Apply this rule **only if at least one condition holds**:
- The file being edited has the extension `.py`.
- The content clearly contains Python syntax (e.g., `def`, `class`, `import`, indentation-based blocks, etc.).

If the content is **not** Python:
→ **Do not apply these rules. Ignore this document entirely.**

If unsure whether the content is Python:
→ **Do not apply the rules.**

## Precedence

Explicit user instructions override these rules.


## Scope

These rules affect **formatting only**.
Do **not** rewrite wording, change semantics, or refactor structure.

## Rules

<!-- TODO: Add Python-specific rules (formatting, naming, typing, etc.) -->

## Non-Goals (Do NOT do this)

<!-- TODO: Add Python-specific non-goals -->
